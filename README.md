# CSES Problem Set Solutions

Contains my [[arpon-kapuria]](https://cses.fi/user/356063) C++ solutions and approaches to the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/).  

## How It Works

- Each problem is categorized by topic.
- I'm using a custom Bash script (`./run`) to compile and run with one simple command.
- All compiled binaries are stored in the `build/` directory to keep things organized.

## Run a Solution

To compile and run any solution:

```py
# from root folder
./run folder_name/file_name.cpp
```

## Problems `52/400`
