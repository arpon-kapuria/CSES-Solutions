## CSES Problem Set Solutions

This repository contains my C++ solutions to the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/).  

### How It Works

- Each problem is categorized by topic.
- I'm using a custom Bash script (`./run`) to compile and run with one simple command.
- All compiled binaries are stored in the `build/` directory to keep things organized.

### Run a Solution

To compile and run any solution:

```py
# from root folder
./run folder_name/file_name.cpp
```
