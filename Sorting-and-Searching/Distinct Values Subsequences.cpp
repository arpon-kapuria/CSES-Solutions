Intuition:
The core idea is a dynamic programming approach. Instead of generating all subsequences, we iterate through the input array and for each element arr[i], we calculate how many times it acts as a "new" distinct value in subsequences ending at that point. We maintain a running product that implicitly helps count these contributions, based on the frequencies of previously seen elements. Modular arithmetic ensures calculations stay within bounds.

Approach:
- Modular Inverse Calculation: Uses Fermat's Little Theorem and binary exponentiation to efficiently compute modular inverses, crucial for division in modular arithmetic.
- Initialization: answer stores the final sum, product is a running product (starts at 1) and frequency maps elements to their counts.
- Iterative Processing: Loop through each element arr[i] of the input array.
- Current Contribution: Calculate subsequences_ending_here. This represents the number of subsequences formed by elements processed before arr[i] where adding arr[i] introduces it as a distinct value. This is derived from the product value, scaled by the inverse of (frequency[arr[i]] + 1).
- Accumulation: Add subsequences_ending_here to the total answer.
- Update Frequencies: Increment frequency[arr[i]].
- Update Product: Adjust the product for the next iteration based on the new frequency of arr[i]. This update maintains the required cumulative value for subsequent calculations.

Time Complexity: O(n log MOD), mod_inverse takes O(log MOD) time, and we process each of the n elements once.
Space Complexity: O(n).
