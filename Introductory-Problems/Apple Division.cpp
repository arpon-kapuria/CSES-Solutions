Approach:

- The problem is essentially a partition problem, where we split apples into two groups with minimum weight difference. 
- This can be reframed as: choose a subset of apples whose total weight is as close as possible to half of the total sum.
- We simulate this choice using recursion: at each index, we decide whether to include the current apple in the first group (currentSum) or not. This naturally explores all possible subsets.
- Once all apples are processed, the other groupâ€™s sum is total_sum - currentSum, so the weight difference is abs(total_sum - 2 * currentSum). In this way, space is saved by tracking only one sum instead of two.
- We return the smallest difference across all subsets by taking the min() of both choices at each step.

Time Complexity: O(2^n) - two choices per apple
Space Complexity: O(n) - maximum recursion depth
